# BasicCodingSection-IEEEAJCESB
Repo for basic code problems in the IEEE SB AJCE Hacktober fest event
The Project intends to be a gateway for all the young devs at Amal Jyothi to enter the wonderful world of Open Source Contribution.
Basically any project is welcome in this repo, but there are certain issues that we focus on at the moment, and we would love to have contributions to that. For more info, Kindly refer the contributors.md file.
Feel free to contact the team in case of any questions.
